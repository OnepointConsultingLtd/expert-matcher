My approachable communication style enables me to build rapport and credibility with stakeholders quickly.\n\nIn 2020 I left corporate life to fulfil my goal of starting my own business and in April I launched Trace along with my friend Joanna.\n\nI started my career in London at a rapidly growing company, where I was part of an entrepreneurial environment and gained experience in product development, experiential marketing and team management. I subsequently moved into strategy consulting, specialising in Financial Services projects predominantly for investment banks.\n\nI relocated to Sydney in 2015 to pursue my career within Macquarie's internal consulting team, where I worked on projects ranging from integrating a newly acquired software company, delivering front to back operational efficiencies in energy trading and facilitating the integration of Macquarie Capital's renewable energy infrastructure assets.\n\nI am passionate about adopting human-centred design to solve problems and identify new opportunities.  At Macquarie, I helped build the Design Thinking and Innovation capability at Macquarie through training delivery and bespoke workshops. \n\nIn 2017 I co-founded 2026 (www.est2026.com.au), a premium fashion brand that designs lifelong, affordable handbags in the fight against fast fashion.
