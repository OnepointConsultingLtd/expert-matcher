A motivational team builder and an excellent communicator with a proven track record of enthusing and energising teams to deliver technical solutions to meet corporate business needs.\n\nHighly experienced in roles including  IT Director, Design Authority, Head of Architecture, Programme Director and leading teams of architects and designers within technically challenging and demanding environments.                                                  \n\nI spend my days listening to companies who've got complex digital challenges they need to overcome to deliver critical business outcomes. These range from providing the best possible customer service and experience, to optimising operational efficiencies, staying on the right side of compliance, and innovating with AI, blockchain, cloud, sensors, low code, and more. They are looking for unbiased and sound advice they can trust.\n\nAll these organisations have a common desire to utilise the power of digital to stay competitive and deliver value to their customers, colleagues and partners. They are all on a journey of becoming digital and data driven but are faced with legacy systems, regulatory pressures, competition, multitude of applications and platforms, and are often overcome with the huge choices that modern digital technology can offer. That's when we come alive.\n\nI've built a team in London and Pune over 15 years that loves to roll up its sleeves and get embroiled in these challenges. We're good listeners, analytical thinkers, collaborators � and ultimately problem solvers.\n\nI've always believed that technology and data are there to improve people's lives and not an end in themselves � I keep everyone focused on that goal. My aim is to see humanity thrive through good business, using the very best that technology can offer.\n\nWe've enjoyed solving complex data and technology problems for the likes of Flight Centre, Meggitt, Vision Express, TUI, Autovista, Carphone Warehouse, AOL Broadband, Tesco Telecom and Travis Perkins, hopefully making the lives of their staff, customers, and partners better than they otherwise might have been.\n",
